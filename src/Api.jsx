         question : "What are the differences between functional and class components?",
         answer : "Before the introduction of Hooks in React, functional components were called stateless components and were behind class components on a feature basis. After the introduction of Hooks, functional components are equivalent to class components.Although functional components are the new trend, the react team insists on keeping class components in React. Therefore, it is important to know how these components differ. "

         question : " What is React Router?",
         answer : " React Router refers to the standard library used for routing in React. It permits us for building a single-page web application in React with navigation without even refreshing the page when the user navigates. It also allows to change the browser URL and will keep the user interface in sync with the URL. React Router will make use of the component structure for calling the components, using which appropriate information can be shown. Since React is a component-based framework, it’s not necessary to include and use this package. Any other compatible routing library would also work with React."
